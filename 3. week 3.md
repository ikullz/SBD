### üóìÔ∏è Week 3: Structured Query Language (SQL)

#### üìç OVERVIEW THE SQL
Early History
- _SQL was originally developed by IBM under the name "sequel" (1970s)_
_Tujuan -> To manipulate and retrieve data from a relational database system_
- _The name "Sequel" was later changed to "Structured Query Language" or "SQL", as we know it today_

Standardization
- _SQL-86: The frist to be adopted as a standard by the ANSI_
- _SQL-89: A minor enhancement to SQL-86_
- _SQL-92 (or SQL2): Introduced many new features and become the most widely adopted standard for several years_
- _SQL:1999 (or SQL3): Added support for advanced features like trigonometry and object-oriented capabilities. The name "SQL:1999" replaced the previous naming format to confrom to Y2K date formating_
- _SQL:2003: Introduced features like XML support and windowed analysis_

Commercial Developments
- _Many commercial database systems support most. if not all, of the features from SQL-91 and incorporate features from the newer standards.
- _However, each system might have its own variations and propietary extensions that don't always conform to the standards. This can lead to differences in syntax and behaviour across different database system._

Catatan:
- It's always crucial to check the documentation for the specific database system you're using.
- _Not all SQL examples or features found in books or online tutorials will work the same way on every system.

#### üìç SQL PARTS
- _Data Manipulations Language (DML): Manage and manipulate data stored in the database_\
  Components:
  - Select: Retrieve data based on specified criteria_
  - Insert: Add new records to a table
  - Delete: Remove records from a table
  - Update: Modify existing records
- _Data Definition Language (DDL):_\
a) _Integrity: to ensures data remains accurate and consistent_\
b) _Viewing: to create a virtual table (view) based on the SELECT results_\
  Components:\
  a) Rules that data must follow, e.g., primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints, and check constraints\
  b) CREATE VIEW command
- _Transaction Control: Wnsures that databases maintan integrity and consistency even in situations where multiple operations are being performed_\
  Components:
  - BEGIN TRANSACTION: Marks the start of a transaction.
  - COMMIT: Saves all the transactions.
  - ROLLBACK: Reverts the database to the state before the beginning of the transaction.
- _Embedded SQL & Dynamic SQL: Allow SQL statements be embedded within general-purpose programming languages, enabling the program to execute SQL commands_\
  Components:
  - Embedded SQL: SQL statements are hard-coded
  - Dynamic SQL: SQL statements are generated and executed dynamically at runtime.
- _Authorization: Manages user permissions and ensures that unauthorized users cannot access or modify data_\
  Components:
  - GRANT: Gives specific privilleges to users or roles.
  - REVOKE: Removes specific privilleges from users or roles.


#### üìç Data Definition Language (DDL)
_Untuk membuat pertama kalinya DDL tujuannya ada 2:_
- _integrity: memastikan data" akurat_
- _viewing: untuk mendefine data_
- _check constraints untuk membuat peraturan_
- _embedeed sql biar lebih fleksibel, menggunakan bahasa yang lain misalkan menggunakan python berkaitan dengan authreziation usernya_
  
##### Domain Types in SQL
- _Char (n): Fixed length character string, with user-specified length n_
- _Varchar (n): Variable length character strings, with user-specified maximum length n_
- _int: Integer (a finite subset of the integers that is machine-dependent)_
- _numeric (p,d): Fixed point number, with user-specified precision of p digits, with d digits to the right of decimal point. (etc, numeric (3,1) allows 44.5 to be stores exactly, but not 444.5 or 0.32)_
- _real, doubl precision: Fixed point and double-precision floating point number, with machine-dependent precision_
- _float (n): Floating point number, with user-specified precision of at least n digits_

##### The Select Clause
- _The select clause lists the attributes desired in the result of a query_\
    - Corresponds to the projection operation of the relational algebra
- _EX: find the names of all instrcutors:_\
                         select name
                         from instructor
- _Note: SQL names are case insensitve (i.e., you may use upper- or lower-case letters.)_\
            - E.g., Name = NAME = name
            - Some people use uppercase wherever we use bold font
