### üóìÔ∏è Week 3: Structured Query Language (SQL)

#### üìç OVERVIEW THE SQL
Early History
- _SQL was originally developed by IBM under the name "sequel" (1970s)_
_Tujuan -> To manipulate and retrieve data from a relational database system_
- _The name "Sequel" was later changed to "Structured Query Language" or "SQL", as we know it today_

Standardization
- _SQL-86: The frist to be adopted as a standard by the ANSI.
- _SQL-89: A minor enhancement to SQL-86.
- _SQL-92 (or SQL2): Introduced many new features and become the most widely adopted standard for several years_
- _SQL:1999 (or SQL3): Added support for advanced features like trigonometry and object-oriented capabilities. The name "SQL:1999" replaced the previous naming format to confrom to Y2K date formating_
- _SQL:2003: Introduced features like XML support and windowed analysis_

Commercial Developments
- _Many commercial database systems support most. if not all, of the features from SQL-91 and incorporate features from the newer standards.
- _However, each system might have its own variations and propietary extensions that don't always conform to the standards. This can lead to differences in syntax and behaviour across different database system._

Catatan:
- It's always crucial to check the documentation for the specific database system you're using.
- _Not all SQL examples or features found in books or online tutorials will work the same way on every system.


#### üìç SQL PARTS
- Data Manipulations Language (DML): Manage and manipulate data stored in the database
- Data Definition Language (DDL):
a) Integrity: to ensures data remains accurate and consistent
b) Viewing: to create a virtual table (view) based on the SELECT results
- Transaction Control: Wnsures that databases maintan integrity and consistency even in situations where multiple operations are being performed
- Embedded SQL & Dynamic SQL: Allow SQL statements be embedded within general-purpose programming languages, enabling the program to execute SQL commands
- Authorization: Manages user permissions and ensures that unauthorized users cannot access or modify data
