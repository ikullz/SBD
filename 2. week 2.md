#### üìç RELATION SCHEMA AND INSTANCE
A relation instance is a specific set of tuples for a given relation schema at a particular point in time. when we say r we're referring to a specifin instance r of the relation schema R its like a snapshot of the data in the relation at a given moment>
- _the current values of a relation are specified by a table_
- _An element t of relation r is called a tuple and is represented bya row in a table_

#### ATRIBUTES AND TUPLES ORDER
- _every attribute in a relation has a predefined set of valid values, known as its domain_
- _attribute values are required to be atomic that is indivisible_
- _the special value null is a member of every domain indicated that the value is "unknown"_

#### üìçKeys
#### SuperKey (SK)
- _A set of one or more attributes that can be used to uniquely identify tuples within a relation_
- _Ex: Both [ID] and [ID, name] are SK because they can be used to uniquely identify instructors. However (ID, name) has an aditional attribute (name) which isn't strictly required for unique identification_
#### Candidate Key (CK)
- _A minimal superkey: it doesn't have any extraneous attributes._
- _Ex: (ID) is a CK because it is minimal and can be used to uniquely identifyu instructors. (ID, name), while a SK, isn't a CK because name is not necessary for unique identification._
#### Primary Key (PK)
- _Among the CK, one is chosen to be the PK. It's used as the main way to uniquely identify tuples within a relation. Can't hv null values. Which one?_
#### Foreign Key (FK)
- _It refers to the PK in another (referenced) relation. A FK in one relation is an attribute or set of attributes that is used to establish a link between the data in two tables_
- _The relation that includes the FK is called the referencing relation. The relation that is referred to by the FK is called the referenced relation._
- _Ex: dept_name in the instructor relation is a FK that references the department relation. It means that every department name in the instructor table must also exist in the department table. This ensures referential integrity._

Tambahan:
- _Yang bisa dijadikan primary key adalah ID, karena ID setiap tupel pasti berbeda_ 
- _kalau ada yang sama id digabung dengan nama_
- _kalau foreign key adalah dept_name, argumennya karena dia ngasih tau nama tempatnya jadi mengaitkan data yang ada. dept name. sebuah atribut layak disebut foreign_
- _key kalau primary key yang bedain suatu tuples_

- _Contoh/Use-Case_
- _Catatan Tambahan_
